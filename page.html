            <p class="entry-para">George William Blanchflower, B.A. (London), served as the first Headmaster of 
                Southland Boys’ High School from its founding in 1881 until 1885. Remembered for his respect towards 
                his pupils and his ability to earn theirs in return, he combined strict discipline with a genuine 
                compassion for their success and school spirit. While not imposing in stature, his professional 
                demeanour, academic regalia, and unwavering commitment to high standards reflected his responsibility 
                as a leader and mentor. Renowned for his incisive wit, he upheld honesty in scholarship, condemning 
                plagiarism and careless work, while encouraging perseverance through rigorous study and mutual 
                accountability. Mr Blanchflower also demonstrated service to the school community,
                often granting early dismissals to support important matches and fostering unity among students.
                <br><br>
                After stepping down as Rector, Mr Blanchflower went on to hold posts in London and Jamaica, later teaching at the University of London.

            </div>
            <p class="entry-para">
                Mr Highton, who served as Headmaster from the late 1880s until 1893, was respected by both staff and 
                pupils for his responsibility in leading the school and maintaining discipline. A tall and dignified 
                figure, he possessed deep knowledge of mathematics and science, excelling particularly in 
                experimental work, and through his service to the school he secured the addition of a science room 
                and chemical laboratory in 1889. Although shy and reserved, he treated others with respect and was 
                known for his compassion, offering personal assistance with science and mathematics to former 
                students. He upheld honesty in conduct, delivering stern public rebukes when behaviour fell short, 
                while remaining the perfect gentleman both in and out of school. His dedication to fostering learning, 
                even beyond students’ formal schooling, demonstrated perseverance in supporting their intellectual growth.
                <br><br> 
                After his resignation in 1893, he pursued business in Underwood and later Victoria.
