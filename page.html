                <h1>G. W. Blanchflower</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="entry-para">George William Blanchflower, B.A. (London), served as the first Headmaster of 
                Southland Boys’ High School from its founding in 1881 until 1885. Remembered for his respect towards 
                his pupils and his ability to earn theirs in return, he combined strict discipline with a genuine 
                compassion for their success and school spirit. While not imposing in stature, his professional 
                demeanour, academic regalia, and unwavering commitment to high standards reflected his responsibility 
                as a leader and mentor. Renowned for his incisive wit, he upheld honesty in scholarship, condemning 
                plagiarism and careless work, while encouraging perseverance through rigorous study and mutual 
                accountability. Mr Blanchflower also demonstrated service to the school community,
                often granting early dismissals to support important matches and fostering unity among students.
                <br><br>
                After stepping down as Rector, Mr Blanchflower went on to hold posts in London and Jamaica, later teaching at the University of London.

                <h1>A. H. Highton</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="entry-para">
                Mr Highton, who served as Headmaster from the late 1880s until 1893, was respected by both staff and 
                pupils for his responsibility in leading the school and maintaining discipline. A tall and dignified 
                figure, he possessed deep knowledge of mathematics and science, excelling particularly in 
                experimental work, and through his service to the school he secured the addition of a science room 
                and chemical laboratory in 1889. Although shy and reserved, he treated others with respect and was 
                known for his compassion, offering personal assistance with science and mathematics to former 
                students. He upheld honesty in conduct, delivering stern public rebukes when behaviour fell short, 
                while remaining the perfect gentleman both in and out of school. His dedication to fostering learning, 
                even beyond students’ formal schooling, demonstrated perseverance in supporting their intellectual growth.
                <br><br> 
                After his resignation in 1893, he pursued business in Underwood and later Victoria.

                <h2>1893 - 1903</h2>
                <h1>H. L. Fowler</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="entry-para">
                Mr Fowler was known for his unwavering responsibility and dedication to thorough, high-quality teaching.
                A specialist in the classics, English, and modern languages, his scholarship was unquestioned, and his 
                ability to explain complex ideas clearly contributed significantly to student understanding. As a 
                disciplinarian, he exemplified honesty and respect, applying rules with fairness and emotional 
                restraint, earning lasting admiration from former pupils. His punishments were perceived not as acts 
                of anger but as natural consequences of wrongdoing, reflecting a deep sense of justice and compassion 
                in his leadership. Mr Fowler’s perseverance in maintaining high standards and consistent discipline 
                without harshness made him a role model for both staff and students. His advancement to the role of 
                principal at Nelson Boys’ College in 1904 and his continued service until retirement in 1921 further
                demonstrated a life committed to service in education and the enduring values of integrity and fairness.
